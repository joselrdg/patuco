1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/joselrdg/patuco.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh

   npm link (in package dir)
   ```
4. Start CLI patuco:
   ```sh
   patuco
   ```

# <br>Quick start:

Copy-paste the stylesheet <link> into your <head> before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.

In HTML:

```sh
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="patucostrap/style/patucoSchema.css" media="screen" />
```

In JSX:

```sh
  import "patucostrap/style/patucoSchema.css"
```

Type in the terminal. In your project directory:

```sh
patuco
```

Save the path where the patuco module is located, configure the path where you want to save your templates and configure the language.

Save the path to the file 'patucoConfig.js':

```sh
/home/tuNombre/.nvm/versions/node/v16.2.0/lib/node_modules/patucostrap/src/scripts/constants/patucoConfig.js
```
